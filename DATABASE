Guidelines to add support for a new SQL database
------------------------------------------------

Let's say you add support for the sqlfoo database

3) Testing
   . Create a t/sqlfoo.pl file on the model of t/mysql.pl
     If possible run a separate server to prevent any lossage during the tests.
     The t1 table will be created during the test and removed afterwards.
   . Create a t/07sqlfoo.t on the model of t/03mysql.t
     The goal of this test file is to check that the 'where' strings generated
     by your module are correct.
   . Create a t/08sqlfoo.t on the model of t/04mysql.t
     The goal of this test file is to create a table (defined in t/sqlfoo.pl),
     fill it, run queries and see if it returns the expected result.

2) Implementation
   . Create lib/Text/Query/BuildSQLsqlfoo.pm on the model of
     lib/Text/Query/BuildSQLMySQL.pm
   . run make TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES=t/07sqlfoo.t test
   . run DBI_DSN=dbi:sqlfoo:... DBI_USER=... DBI_PASS make TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES=t/08sqlfoo.t test
   . run make test

3) Documentation
   . Update the README file
   . Add a README.sqlfoo to shortly describe how to install the 
     associated perl module
